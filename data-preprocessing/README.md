Some of the machine learning datasets include:
- [Iris Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris) from Fisher, 1936 
- [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset) from Kaggle 
- [Kaggle Housing Prices Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/housing-prices-dataset) from Kaggle
