# Preprocessing notebooks 

## Classification Datasets 
- `titanic.ipynb`: preprocessing for the Kaggle Titanic dataset.
- `iris.ipynb`: preprocessing for the Bezdek Iris dataset.

## Regression Datasets
- `housing.ipynb`: preprocessing for the Kaggle Housing dataset.

## Notes
- `housing.ipynb`: log transformations have been applied to the target variable, price. To obtain predictions, you must convert the output prediction for your model back from log scale.
- `titanic.ipynb`: a binary classification dataset, no special remarks.
- `iris.ipynb`: a multi class classification dataset, the target variable or expected output for this problem is a matrix of probabilities and not a single value.
